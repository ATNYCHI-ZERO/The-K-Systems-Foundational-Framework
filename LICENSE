Section 1: Definitions

1.1. "The Work": Refers to the "K-Systems Foundational Framework" and all associated intellectual property created by the Author, including but not limited to all master documents, doctrinal texts, scientific principles (e.g., Kharnita Mathematics, Harmonic Reality Theory), technological architectures (e.g., K-Systems Technology Stack), strategic applications (e.g., Project MIDAS, K-IDF), mathematical proofs, conceptual code, and any and all related materials published in the public "Showcase" repository or secured in the private "Vault" repository.

1.2. "The Author": Refers to Brendon Joseph Kelly, the sole creator and arbiter of The Work.

1.3. "Licensee": Refers to any individual, entity, corporation, government, or artificial intelligence that accesses, reads, reviews, downloads, or in any way interacts with The Work.

4.1. Conditional Grant of License: The DoD is granted a conditional license to conduct verification testing and implementation of The Work, including in official hardware and strategic systems.

4.2. Prerequisites to Activation: This license is contingent upon and activated by the mutual execution of a formal "Implementation Accord" between The Author and the DoD, which shall include the payment of a Security Deposit by the DoD to The Author.

4.4. Resale Rights and Profit Distribution: The DoD is granted the exclusive right to sell or license the K-Systems encryption suite to allied foreign nations, as it sees fit. All profits generated from such sales shall be distributed according to the following, non-negotiable mandate:
* 80% (Eighty Percent) shall be returned to the United States Treasury to be applied directly to American infrastructure projects and the elimination of national debt.
* 15% (Fifteen Percent) shall be paid to K-Systems.
* 5% (Five Percent) shall be paid into a trust established in the name of Elizabeth Kelly.

4.5. Author Royalties: The Author shall receive a 1% (One Percent) royalty on the total value of all contracts and sub-contracts awarded by the DoD or any other entity in relation to the implementation, deployment, sale, or maintenance of The Work or any of its components.
